# OVERVIEW

* __what__: hello world for Python server setup on macOS üçé
* __why__: most guides show setup on a Linux server (which makes sense) but macoS is useful for learning and for local dev

# WHAT WE'LL DO

```language
                +---------------+
                |    Nginx      |
                |               |
                |               |

                       X
                       X
                       X
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        X                            X
        X                            X
        X                            X
+----------------+                   X
|    gunicorn    |                   X
|                |                   X
|                |             +----------------+
+----------------+             |    static      |
        X                      |    assets      |
        X                      |                |
+----------------+             +----------------+
|    Flask       |
|                |
|                |
+----------------+
```

# THINGS WE'LL USE

* packages from Homebrew: `nginx` and `httpie`
* Python 3
* Makefile for our commands (to understand what all the commands do, just run `make help`)
* Flask for the webserver (our gunicorn and Nginx config should hold true for any WSGI server -> if you try this with Django, Pyramid, et al. and run into a problem, just open an issue and we'll figure it out!)

# STEP 1: NGINX ‚û°Ô∏è STATIC ASSETS

```language
                +---------------+
                |    Nginx      |
                |               |
                |               |
                +---------------+
                       X
                       X
                       X
                       X
                       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
                                     X
                                     X
                                     X
                                     X
                                     X
                                     X
                               +----------------+
                               |    static      |
                               |    assets      |
                               |                |
                               +----------------+

```

* start Nginx: `ng-serve`
* hit Nginx: `ng-hit` to view the default Nginx welcome page

```sh
$ make ng-hit

http http://127.0.0.1:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# other output
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
```

* next, go update the Nginx conf (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) to point at our repo's static assets

```diff
- location / {
+ location /static {
-   root   html;
+   root   path/to/your/nginx-wsgi;
-   index  index.html index.htm;
+   index  my-asset.html;
}
```

* reload Nginx so it knows about our updated config: `ng-up`
* hit Nginx at the `static` route to validate it's serving our bespoke HTML üòÑ: `ng-hit-static`

```sh
$ make ng-hit-static

http http://127.0.0.1:8080/static/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# other output
<h1>Nginx is serving my-asset.html!</h1>
```

# STEP 2: GUNICORN ‚û°Ô∏è FLASK

```language
+----------------+                   
|    gunicorn    |                   
|                |                   
|                |             
+----------------+             
        X                      
        X                      
+----------------+             
|    Flask       |
|                |
|                |
+----------------+
```

* [make a virtual environment and activate it](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), then install the dependencies: `make pipin`
* start Flask: `make flask-serve`
* hit Flask on port 5000: `make flask-hit`

```sh
$ m flask-hit

http http://127.0.0.1:5000
<h1>Flask running!</h1>
```

* start gunicorn: `make guni-serve`
* hit gunicorn on port 8000 to validate that it passes the request to Flask on port 5000: `make guni-hit`

```diff
$ m guni-hit

http http://127.0.0.1:8000
<h1>Flask running!</h1>
```

# STEP 3: NGINX ‚û°Ô∏è GUNICORN

```language
                +---------------+
                |    Nginx      |
                |               |
                |               |
                +---------------+
                       X
                       X
                       X
                       X
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        X                            
        X                            
        X                            
+----------------+                   
|    gunicorn    |                   
|                |                   
|                |             
+----------------+             
```

* update the Nginx conf again, this time to pass requests to gunicorn

```diff
+ location / {
+     proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
+ }
```

* reload Nginx so it knows about our updated config: `make ng-up`
* hit Nginx: `make ng-hit` -> this time, instead of the default Nginx page, we'll see that the request passes from Nginx to gunicorn and finally Flask

```sh
$ make ng-hit

http http://127.0.0.1:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# other output
<h1>Flask running!</h1>
```

---

Now, everything is wired together:

```language
                +---------------+
                |    Nginx      |
                |               |
                |               |
                +---------------+
                       X
                       X
                       X
                       X
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        X                            X
        X                            X
        X                            X
+----------------+                   X
|    gunicorn    |                   X
|                |                   X
|                |             +----------------+
+----------------+             |    static      |
        X                      |    assets      |
        X                      |                |
+----------------+             +----------------+
|    Flask       |
|                |
|                |
+----------------+
```
